## Example Project using React-Native 0.18.-rc and Redux 3.0.4 and React-Redux 4.0.5

This is a repo for starting a react-native app using Redux.

### Usage

clone the project and run `npm install`.

I have to do couple of cleanup after `npm install` you can follow up on this [react-redux issue](https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/issues/236)

Cheers,
