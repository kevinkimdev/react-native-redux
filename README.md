## Counter Example

#### React-Native 0.19.0 & Redux 3.1.7 & React-Redux 4.1.2

This repo demonstrates the usage of latest React-Native with Redux.

### Usage

- clone the project
- run `npm install`
- if you are using npm version 2 then you need to run the following command, npm@3 won't need this command. to follow up why you need to run this command you can look at this [issue](https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/issues/236)

```js
npm run setup_project
```

> NOTE: You don't need to run the above command if you are using npm3.

Cheers,
